#Biography

Hello! I am from Houston, Texas and currently attend The University of Texas at Austin. I major in Biology and plan on attending medical school after finishing my degree. I volunteer at Dell Seaton Medical Center and enjoy learning from medical professionals as well as patients. I hope to one day be able to care for others as a doctor and continue learning from the people I meet.
