```{r}
library(reticulate)
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON="/usr/bin/python")
use_python("/usr/bin/python")
```


The reticulate package let's R and python work together!
Simply define something in the R code chunk

```{r}
so<- "Stay Healthy"
```

then define something in the python code chunk. After you print out the result you can show your message!

```{python} 
cool="Everyone"
print(r.so,cool) 
```

These are hard times for many people so here are some memes to brighten your day!
