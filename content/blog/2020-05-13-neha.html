<p>Project Topics</p>
<p>I decided to analyze traffic data for my projects because driving is something most of us can relate to. Driving is a daily activity that most of us do not think about when we are doing it but there are many things that can subconsciously contribute to how we drive. I chose to analyze data regarding the presence of traffic cameras, as well as laws we are aware of to see if it had any effect on how safe people drive. Different states implement different laws and regulations regarding traffic safety and I wanted to see if there was any relation to the party the state is most affiliated with had anything to do with the implementation of those regulations. I analyzed the safety of drivers by looking at the number of accidents caused by different vehicles as well as different reasonings for those accidents such as distracted driving. My projects show what relations I found and whether the traffic policies we have are having any effect on how safe our roads are.</p>
